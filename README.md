üìä Final Project: Web Traffic Analysis for SberAutoSubscription

Course: Introduction to Data 

ScienceAuthor: Akbar

Language: Python + Jupyter Notebook

Project type: Exploratory Data Analysis + Hypothesis Testing (Data Analyst specialization)


üè¢ About the Project

This project is based on real analytical tasks from SberAutoSubscription, a Russian service offering long-term car rentals. The goal was to explore web traffic data collected via Google Analytics, evaluate user behavior, and provide data-driven answers to product questions.
The dataset includes detailed information on user sessions and interactions with the website ‚Äî device types, traffic sources, user actions, and more.

‚úÖ Objectives
1. Data Preparation

-Read and explore both datasets (ga_sessions.pkl and ga_hits.pkl)

-Assess data completeness and cleanliness

-Normalize and preprocess for further analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns

-Handle missing values and incorrect types

-Visualize key attributes (e.g., device category, city, traffic source)

-Analyze CR (conversion rate) per session

3. Hypothesis Testing

-Using statistical tests (like z-test or chi-squared test), the following hypotheses were tested:

-There is no difference in conversion rate (CR) between organic and paid traffic

-There is no difference in CR between mobile and desktop devices

-There is no difference in CR between users from major cities (Moscow, SPb) and other regions

4. Business Questions Answered

-Which traffic sources bring the most target traffic (volume + CR)?

-Which car models are the most popular and have the best CR?

-Should we invest more in social media advertising?


üìà Tools & Libraries

-pandas, numpy

-matplotlib, seaborn

-scipy.stats for hypothesis testing

-Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
